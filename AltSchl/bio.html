        <h3>BECOMING A FRONTEND ENGINEER</h3>
        <p>
          I'm <strong> Zaynab Gbede; </strong> a young lady currently residing
          in Lagos, Nigeria who has always been fascinated by how the internet
          works and how it is designed. My journey into tech began years back
          when I interned as an IT support officer in the technology team of an
          organization. I was deeply inspired by the people I worked with, which
          sparked an itch to delve deeper into the tech world. Fast forward to
          this year, I finally decided to fulfill that itch but wasn't sure
          where or how to start. After careful consideration and research, I
          chose to join ALTSCHOOL Africa to pursue a career as a frontend
          engineer. The first semester has been a rollercoasterâ€”challenging and
          bittersweet. The journey has become very personal to me; the
          frustration of not getting code right can give me headaches, but the
          bliss I feel when I finally crack it is unmatched. Walk this journey
          with me as I continue to progress and grow in the tech world.

        <h3>Why ALTSCHOOL?</h3>
        <p>
          I enrolled at AltSchool in order to gain structured, practical
          experience in frontend programming that would prepare me for the
          working world as they offer a well-structured curriculum that guides
          students through the necessary skills and knowledge needed to become a
          proficient frontend engineer. This structured approach was appealing
          to me because it ensures that I cover all the essential topics in a
          logical and comprehensive way. I needed to be part of AltSchool's
          helpful community for like-minded learners and their real-world
          projects to help me transition into a tech industry and accomplish my
          long-term objectives. AltSchool's supportive environment was a big factor in
          my decision because I believe in learning collaboratively and
          benefiting from the experiences of others.
